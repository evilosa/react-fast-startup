Hi man! Usually we spend a lot of time to create basic CRUD app for test our idea.
Stop waste your time and spend money. Use TDD way in bussiness:
1) Red - define idea for startup
2) Green - fast create App from scratch to pass idea features
3) Refactor - if bussiness idea works - start to refactor it to final App.

This project should help you to save hours of your life. Spend it to the family, fun, friends and anything else.

Main idea - you should create backend API with your favourite language and generators, and define models in accordings to
React-fast-startup notations. Feed it to pipeline and receive completed project in couple of hours.
